# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial develops individualized financial plans for its custmers. They want to modernize their operations. Artemis wanted to transform their current software securtiy. Artemis required an upgrade to the most effective security to protect their client data and financial information. They also wanted to add a file verification step in the form of a checksum.

# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I believe that I did well in addressing Artemis's software securtiy vulnerabilites. Especially updating the application versions. It is important to code securily to reducde the risk of attacks on the applications.
This adds immense value because coding securely will save the company funds from having to fix vulnerabilities that were susceptible to attacks. Also if an attack occured that put clients fiancial information in the hands of people without access. Then they would be getting sued by 
the clients. Therefore, coding securely is crucial to the company's well-being.

# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The part of the vulnerability assessment that was challenging to me was the depencdecy checks. I was not able to solve all of the vulnerabilites that had come up on the report. I think if the report gave a little bit more clear information on why something came up as a vulnerability then, it would have been easier for me to sole. Maybe there is another program that can help with this.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased levels of security by implementing multioke measures, including enforcing encrypted communication, strengthening cryptographic integrity, and updating dependencies to remove vulnerabilities. In the future, I was lookinga t other vulnerability scanning tools. I would utilize Nessus to run my reports.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I was able to remove most of the vulnerabilities. However, I was not able for others. For the ones that i was able to remove, i refactored the code to reduce the vulnerbaility by using secure coding practices. I was able to check my progress by using the vulnerability scanning tool, Owasp.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Utilizing GeeksForGeeks was very helpful with the assignments, as they give a wealth of information for you to learn about what you would be working on. I would reccommend to stop there first.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show future employers my ability to remove vulnerabilities. Although, I am not the best at it now. I have a good foundational knowledge on how to increase my skills in this area.
